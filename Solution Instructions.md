# Solution Instructions

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that your system has Python (3.9 or higher) installed. To verify, run `python --version` or `python3 --version` on your terminal or command prompt.
- If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Running the Solution

1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Use `cd` to navigate to the directory where `adventurerPath.py` is located.
3. Run the script using Python by executing the following command: `python adventurerPath.py`
   - The program will output the calculated distance based on the directions provided in [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md).

## Modifying the Directions

- To test with different directions, run the script with a different path as a command-line argument. For example: `python adventurerPath.py "2F3B6L"`
- This allows the program to be tested with simpler directions for easier debugging.
